It was 1971 and as the Swinging Sixties had given way to the Super Seventies, fashions and tastes were changing. Two hungry young Americans were in London and couldn’t find a decent place to eat a decent burger… so they opened up a joint in the English capital. Their landlord didn’t think it would last and only gave them a six-month lease. Four decades later, there are almost 200 Hard Rock Cafes in more than 50 countries worldwide.</p><p><br></p><p> The first T-shirt hit the streets in ‘74 and the first piece of memorabilia came, fittingly, by chance in ‘79 when Eric Clapton asked to hang his Lead II Fender guitar over his favourite bar stool and thus marked it as his spot. Today, the rock 'n' roll collection has more than 74,000 pieces and is the largest of its kind. By 1982, the Hard Rock Cafe had gone global and the rest, as they say, is history (that’s still being written).</p><p>Choose from one of the following menus:</p><p><strong>GOLD MENU</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> MAINS</strong></p><p><strong> Original Legendary® Burger </strong></p><p> Fresh Black Angus steak burger, with smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, crispy onion ring, leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato, served with our signature steak sauce and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Moving Mountains® Burger</strong></p><p> 100% plant-based patty, topped with cheddar cheese and a crispy onion ring, served with leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato, and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Grilled Chicken Sandwich </strong></p><p> Grilled chicken with melted Monterey Jack cheese, smoked bacon, leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato, served on a toasted fresh bun with honey mustard sauce and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Twisted Mac, Chicken &amp; Cheese </strong></p><p> Grilled chicken breast, sliced and served on cavatappi pasta tossed in a four-cheese sauce blend with diced red peppers.</p><p> <strong>Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad </strong></p><p> Grilled chicken with fresh romaine tossed in a classic tossed in a classic Caesar dressing, topped with parmesan crisps, croutons and shaved parmesan cheese.</p><p> <strong>BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich </strong></p><p> Hand-pulled smoked pork with our house-made barbecue sauce, served on a toasted fresh bun with coleslaw, sliced Granny Smith apples and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Tupelo Chicken Tenders </strong></p><p> Crispy chicken tenders served with seasoned fries, honey mustard and our house-made barbecue sauce.</p><p> </p><p> <strong>DESSERT</strong></p><p><strong> Brownie </strong></p><p> Warm chocolate brownie with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped cream.</p><p> </p><p> <strong>DRINKS </strong></p><p> 1 Soft drink, coffee or tea</p><p> </p><p> <strong>DIAMOND MENU</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> STARTERS </strong></p><p> Caesar Or House Salad</p><p> Nachos to Share ** (1 per every 3-4 guests)</p><p> </p><p> <strong>MAINS</strong></p><p><strong> Original Legendary® Burger </strong></p><p> Fresh Black Angus steak burger, with smoked bacon, cheddar cheese, crispy onion ring, leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato, served with our signature steak sauce and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Moving Mountains® Burger </strong></p><p> 100% plant-based patty, topped with cheddar cheese and a crispy onion ring, served with leaf lettuce and vine-ripened tomato and seasoned fries on the side.</p><p> <strong>Smoked BBQ Combo </strong></p><p> Slow-cooked Baby Back Ribs and hand-pulled smoked pork served with our house-made barbecue sauce.
